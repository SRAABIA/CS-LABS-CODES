	PRIMITIVE DATATYPE:
	These datatypes are built-in datatypes and can be directly accessed by the user
	for example:
	int, char, float, double, bool
	
	DERIVED DATATYPE:
	These datatypes are derived from already built-in datatypes i.e. int, char, float etc.
	They simply add more features to primitive datatypes. 
	for example:
	arrays, functions, pointers, structures
	here;
	pointer is a derived datatype which stores the address of other primitive datatypes.
